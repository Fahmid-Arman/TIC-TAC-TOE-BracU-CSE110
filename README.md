# TIC-TAC-TOE Game in Python

This repository contains a Python implementation of the classic **TIC-TAC-TOE** game, developed as part of the coursework for **CSE110** at **BRAC University**.

The game is designed for two players, who take turns placing their symbols (`X` and `O`) on a 3x3 board. The game ends when one player aligns three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or when the board is filled with no winner, resulting in a draw.

### How to Run the Game
To play the game, first clone this repository to your local machine using the command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tic-tac-toe.git
cd tic-tac-toe
python tic_tac_toe.py
